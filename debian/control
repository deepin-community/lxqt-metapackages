Description: Metapackage for the LXQt core
 LXQt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based on Qt
 technologies. It has been tailored for users who value simplicity, speed, and
 an intuitive interface. Unlike most desktop environments, LXQt also works
 fine with less powerful machines.
 .
 This package is a metapackage meant to provide the core components of LXQt.
 These include pcmanfm-qt, lxqt-panel, lxqt-runner, lxqt-session and esp.
 lxqt-qtplugin (needed for communication between session, components and
 applications).
 .
 Recommend for lean and/or parallel installation with other desktop
 environments.
